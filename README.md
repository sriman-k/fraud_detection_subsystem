# 🚀 Fraud Detection Subsystem

This project implements a **transaction monitoring subsystem** designed to detect fraudulent transactions based on **rule-based checks** and **unsupervised machine learning models**. Since labeled fraud data is unavailable, this system uses **anomaly detection** methods to flag suspicious transactions.

## 📌 **Fraud Detection Rules**
### 🔹 **Rule A: Standard Deviation-Based Anomaly Detection**
**Why?**  
Fraudulent transactions often have **unusually high or low amounts** compared to a user's normal spending behavior.

**Implementation:**  
A transaction is **flagged if it is more than 2.5 standard deviations** away from the user's average transaction amount.  
- **Threshold:** `2.5 SD` ensures extreme outliers are captured while minimizing false positives.
- **Lower thresholds →** Too many false positives.
- **Higher thresholds →** Might miss fraudulent activity.

---

### 🔹 **Rule B: High Transaction Volume (Unusual Activity Rule)**
**Why?**  
Fraudsters may take control of an account and execute **many transactions in a short period**.  

**Implementation:**  
- If a user’s transaction count is in the **top 2% (98th percentile)** of all users, their transactions are **flagged**.
- Fraudulent users often execute **bulk transactions** to exploit stolen credentials.

---

### 🔹 **Rule C: Large Transactions Relative to User's History**
**Why?**  
Fraudsters often **execute large transactions** to maximize their gain before detection.

**Implementation:**  
- Transactions that are **2.5 standard deviations above the user’s average amount** are flagged.
- Ensures **user-specific thresholds** rather than a fixed transaction limit.

---

### 🔹 **Rule D: High Velocity Transactions**
**Why?**  
Fraudsters may execute **multiple rapid transactions** before the account holder notices.

**Implementation:**  
- If a user executes **more than 4 transactions within 5 minutes**, they are flagged.
- Captures **rapid transaction bursts** while avoiding false positives from normal spending behavior.

---

### 🔹 **Rule E: Transactions at Unusual Times**
**Why?**  
Fraudulent transactions **often occur late at night** when users are less likely to notice them.

**Implementation:**  
- **Transactions between 12 AM – 4 AM** are flagged.
- Studies show fraud attempts **increase** during off-hours.

## 🤖 **Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection**
Since fraudulent transactions do not always follow explicit patterns, **unsupervised ML** is used to detect anomalies.

### 🔹 **Rule F: ML-Based Anomaly Detection (Gaussian Mixture & Isolation Forest)**
1️⃣ **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**
   - Learns spending patterns **dynamically** and assigns a **likelihood score** to transactions.
   - **Features used:**
     - `amount`
     - `txn_hour`
     - `txn_dow`
     - `amt_to_avg_ratio` (transaction value compared to user's mean spending)
   - **Anomalous transactions → Low probability scores.**
   - Uses `n_components=4` (assuming 4 transaction behavior types).

2️⃣ **Isolation Forest**
   - Identifies **anomalies in transaction patterns** by splitting data recursively.
   - **Features used:** Same as GMM.
   - **Hyperparameters:**
     - `n_estimators=100`
     - `contamination=0.005` (assumes **0.5% of transactions** are fraudulent).
   - Transactions **with low anomaly scores** are flagged.

3️⃣ **Final Decision:**
   - If **both models agree** that a transaction is fraudulent, it is flagged.

### 🔹 **Rule G: NLP-Based Merchant Name Anomaly Detection**
**Why?**  
Fraudulent transactions may involve **rare or suspicious merchants**.

**Implementation:**
1. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Merchant names are **tokenized** using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
   - Uses **character-based n-grams (3-5 chars)** to capture **misspellings or slight variations**.

2. **Merchant Clustering with DBSCAN:**
   - Detects **merchant outliers** using density-based clustering.
   - `eps=0.4`, `min_samples=4` to ensure distinct clusters.

3. **Isolation Forest on Merchant Embeddings:**
   - Flags **merchants significantly different** from known merchants.
   - Helps detect **small-scale merchant fraud**.

**Why is this effective?**
✔ Prevents fraud through **obscure or manipulated merchant names**.  
✔ Detects **small-scale fraud** that traditional rules miss.  
✔ Reduces **false positives** by ensuring true merchant anomalies.

## 📊 **Why Use Unsupervised Learning?**
Traditional **supervised ML** requires labeled fraud data, which is unavailable in this case. Instead, we use **unsupervised anomaly detection**:

1️⃣ **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**
   - Learns statistical clusters of spending behavior.
2️⃣ **Isolation Forest**
   - Identifies anomalies in transaction patterns.
3️⃣ **DBSCAN (NLP-based merchant analysis)**
   - Clusters merchants based on name similarity to flag **fake or unusual merchants**.

Together, these models provide a **robust fraud detection system** capable of identifying suspicious transactions **without labeled data**.
